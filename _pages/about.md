My main research interest lies in elementary particle physics theory, focusing on high-energy collider physics as well as connections to astro-particle physics and cosmology.While the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics provides a remarkably successful description of elementary matter and forces, it fails to address a number of outstanding conceptual and empirical mysteries, such as the naturalness of electroweak scale, the strong CP problem, the nature of dark matter (DM), and the origin of neutrino masses. Clearly the SM must be extended and become part of a deeper structure that will explain these shortcomings, with new physics beyond the SM expected to emerge at some high energy scale. I aim to test the SM itself and search for possible new physics at high-energy colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and other future collider programs (ILC, CLIC, CEPC/SPPC, FCC-ee/hh, muon colliders, etc.)
